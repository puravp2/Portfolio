 <h1>About Me :</h1>
 <p> One of my strengths is that I am a person that won't quit. Through coding for 3 years there were many errors but even if it gets too frustrating I will try to find a way to solve that problem. One of my weaknesses is that I am not the best in math. Math is a crucial part of coding.
